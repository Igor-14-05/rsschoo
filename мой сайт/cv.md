		var s="";
		var t=num.toString();
		for (var i=0;i<t.length;i++)
		{
 			var k= Number(t[i]);

    	This is code for this task:
    	Here i must to square every digit of a number.
    	For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
    	Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
